# some notes
Notes belonging to my forked version.

## Updates from origin
I always forget this so I'll make a note here:

```sh
## this only needs to be done first time (add upstream as a remote branch):
# git remote add upstream https://github.com/mynameisfiber/gohll

# fetch upstrea
git fetch upstream

# merge upstream
git merge upstream/master

# push local
git push origin master
```
